v2.0.0
2015/11/08

    - Support 2GB+ messages as long as platform off_t is large enough.

    - Support asynchronous ClamAV scanning using pthreads.

    - Support message trickling: Send small message pieces to the
      recipient while the adapter downloads and analyses the message.
      The recipient is unlikely to terminate the connection if the
      data keeps trickling in.

    - Significantly improved configuration documentation in README.

    - Deprecated huge_size in favor of the new message_size_max.

    - Fixed out-of-source build.


    The following changes may be of interest to developers following
    this code or triaging host application regressions:

    - Calling Xaction::stop() is no longer mandatory, resolving an XXX
      that wanted the host transaction to call stop() for non-
      start()ed adapter transactions!

    - Adapter now throws if the host application requests invalid
      adapted body offset. We used to return an empty area instead.

    - Made GCC -Wvla -Wshadow -Wempty-body -Wunused-parameter happy.

    - More consistent source code formatting using UniForm/uncrustify.


v1.0.0
2014/09/02
    - Support, require, and check for libecap v1.0.

    - Fixed build failure due to missing <unistd.h> #include.
    - LP Bug #800281: Initialization failure after squid -k reconfigure.
    - LP Bug #1025567: Service constructor segfault during adapter loading.

v0.2.1
2011/04/06

    - Fixed build failure due to missing config.h #include file.


v0.2.0
2011/03/15

    - Support, require, and check for libecap v0.2.

    - Supply detected virus ID to the host application via the eCAP
      X-Virus-ID meta-header. The host may log the supplied virus ID with
      other transaction details or perform other host-specific
      notification actions.

    - Made unknown service options a fatal configuration error as opposed
      to just a warning.

    - Added debug=full|none ClamAV service option to enable debugging.
      This feature is based on undocumented cl_debug() ClamAV API and
      suffers from that API limitations: If enabled for one service, all
      services will be debugged, and debugging can no longer be turned
      off. More work is needed (using unstable ClamAV debugging callback
      interfaces) to make debugging usable beyond lab tests.


v0.1.1
2011/01/09

    - Fixed stuck transactions, typically visible with large bodies.

    - Use GPL v2, the minimally restrictive license allowed by libclamav.

    - Updated documentation.

    - First external release, after a major rewrite.
      Requires libecap v0.1.


v0.0.2
2008/09/30

    - First internal release.
      Requires libecap v0.0.3.
